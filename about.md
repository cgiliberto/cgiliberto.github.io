Hello, I'm Christian Giliberto, a student interested in artificial intelligence, statistics, philosophy, scientific computing, cognitive science, and information security, among other things.  Currently I'm an undergraduate in computer science and mathematics in the Northeastern United States.

In general I'm fascinated by how broadly computational approaches can help us understand problems of inference, modeling, and decision-making in various domains.
